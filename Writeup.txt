TeeTyme is an application designed to store and track golf scores and related information. Specifically, it keeps basic descriptive data on golf courses, including the address and the pars on different holes. It stores contact information for golfers; and finally, it tracks golfers' scores across multiple rounds of play. After one inserts the data for themselves and the course they are golfing on (assuming neither of these exist), they can keep track of the time, date, and number of strokes per hole as they go. TeeTyme also allows for basic file storage, such as for pictures of golf courses.
